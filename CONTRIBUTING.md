## New Contributor Guide

If you're new to open-source or QFlux, welcome! You're encouraged to start by:

* Reading existing issues.
* Examining existing example notebooks under `demos/`.
* Looking at the `good first issue` or `help wanted` tags.
* Exploring the source code under `src/qflux`.
* Reviewing [documentation](https://qflux.batistalab.com/) in the `docs/` folder (built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)).

---

## Getting Started

### Requirements

QFlux uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management. You will need:

* Python â‰¥3.10
* [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv): Install with `pip install uv`
* [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for documentation
* [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:batistagroup/qflux.git
cd qflux
```

### Project structure

```
qflux/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/           # Core package source code, split according to subdomain (e.g., src/qflux)
â”œâ”€â”€ data/          # Input/output data files for examples
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/          # Markdown documentation for use with MkDocs
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/         # Unit and integration tests
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml # Project configuration with uv and build info
```

2. Use an appropriate template (e.g., *bug*, *feature request*, or *question*).
3. Be concise and clear.
4. Link to relevant code lines/commit if applicable.

### Solve an Issue

* If you'd like to address an open issue, comment on it to indicate you're working on it.
* Fork the repository and follow the development workflow below.

## Make Changes

### New Feature

1. Create a feature branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/qumode_dynamics
   ```
2. Implement your code under a relevant submodule of `src/qflux/`.
3. Add or update relevant tests in `tests/`.
4. Ensure the test suite passes:

   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   pytest
   ```

### Documentation Updates

1. Make a docs-related branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b docs/pII_open_systems_spinchain
   ```
2. Edit the relevant markdown file in the `docs/` directory:

   ```bash
   vim docs/qflux/Open_Systems/spin_chain.md
   ```
3. Preview the documentation to ensure all markdown is correctly rendered under mkdocs:

   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```
4. If a new page, ensure it is added to the navigation of `qflux/mkdocs.yml`:
   ```yml
   nav: # Note: All paths must be relative to the docs dir
     - Open Systems:
       - Spin Chain Demo: 'qflux/Open_Systems/spinchainOpen.md'
   ```
5. Commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git add docs/qflux/Open_Systems/spin_chain.md
   git commit -m 'DOCS: Added docs on the spin chain example with Lindblad'
   git push
   ```

> ðŸ“Œ All documentation should be concise and **not a copy-paste of manuscripts or tutorials**. Use clear markdown formatting. For ease of editing, use VSCode, jupyter nobeooks or vim with mkdocs serve.

---

## Commiting the Update

Follow [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines:

* `FEAT:` for new features
* `FIX:` for bug fixes
* `DOCS:` for documentation
* `TEST:` for testing additions
* `REFACTOR:` for code improvements

Example:

```bash
git commit -m "FEAT: Add Lindblad trajectory sampling module"
```

---

## Pull Request

1. Push your feature branch:

   ```bash
   git push origin feat/qumode_dynamics
   ```
2. Open a PR against the `main` branch via GitHub.
3. Provide a meaningful title and description.
4. Link related issues using keywords like `Closes #42`.

---

## Merging a Pull Request

* All PRs should be reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer.
* Ensure the CI (tests + docs build) passes.

---

## Keeping Your Fork Updated

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/batistagroup/qflux.git
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```
