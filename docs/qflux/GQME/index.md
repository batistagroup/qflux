![Logo](../../img/qflux-logo.png)

This section includes documentation and tutorials focused on illustrating the usage and versatility of the `qflux.GQME` module. 

## Overview

First, we will provide some conceptual explanations that provide the user with a necessary background to understand the generalized quantum master equation (GQME). Then we provide some illustrative examples that demonstrate how the `qflux` can be used to solving the GQME. Finally, we provide the source code as an API reference to the source code.

## Examples and Introductory Concepts 

Our documentation includes the following sections:

- [Introduction to GQME](What_is_GQME.md)
- [Introduction to TT-TFD](What_is_TTTFD.md)
- [GQME for Spin-Boson model](spin_boson_GQME.md)
