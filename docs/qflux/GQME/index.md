# GQME Documentation and User Guide

![Logo](../../img/qflux-logo.png)

This section includes documentation and tutorials focused on illustrating the usage and versatility of the `qflux.GQME` module. 

## Overview

We begin with some conceptual explanations that provide the user with a necessary background to understand the generalized quantum master equation (GQME). Then we provide some illustrative examples that demonstrate how the `qflux` can be used to solve the Generalized Quantum Master Equation (GQME). Finally, we provide the source code as an API reference to the source code.

## Installation Note: 

To run these tutorials, you will have to run:

```python
pip install "qflux[gqme]"
```

## Examples and Introductory Concepts
