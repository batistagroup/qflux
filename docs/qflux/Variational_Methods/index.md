# Variational Methods  Module

## Overview

In this section, we outline the main functionality of the `variational_methods` module. 

First, we will provide some conceptual explanations that provide the user with a necessary background to understand the code. Then we provide some illustrative examples that demonstrate how the code can be used. Finally, we provide the source code as an API reference to the source code.

## Concepts
